            <p>So far, AI scientists have achieved success in creating AI-powered machines and gadgets with reasoning, speech, and vision. A wide range of machines, devices, and tools powered by AI have been invented by AI scientists. Examples of AI technology can be seen in our daily lives. When we are typing a text on a computer or on a mobile, we notice a pop-up message suddenly appearing on the screen, suggesting what we should write next. Most of the time, these suggestions are quite the same as what we are going to write. It seems that the computer can read our minds. This is how a computer programme called “text editor” helps us with word processing. While typing a text, we also tend to make spelling mistakes. At such time, these mistakes are automatically corrected by the computer. This is what we call the auto-correction feature of a computer software application.</p> 

            <p>We have more examples of AI technology in various sectors. In the security and surveillance sector, facial recognition systems and security cameras help the police find missing persons, detect criminals, and protect our home. In the transportation sector, self-driving cars or driverless cars powered by AI technology are becoming more and more popular because they can reduce driver error as well as the number of accidents. In the past, it was different for us to find a location of a big city. Now the Google Maps and GPS Navigation Apps installed on our mobiles help us get to an unfamiliar place just by following the direction. In hospitals, AI is used in several ways to promote the quality of healthcare, for example, in delivering food, water, and medicines. We have witnessed to patients with COVID-19. Space scientists are now using unmanned spacecraft with AI tools to study unknown stars and black holes.</p>
	    <p>In the field of education, AI can help teachers in grading tests, retrieving up-to-date information on their subject matter, writing progress reports, etc. For today’s students, who are digital natives, etc. AI is their everything: playmate, friend, tutor, advisor, etc., AI can even be a personal classroom where they can learn what they wish. AI greatly contributes to the conservation of the natural environment as well. We are using AI-powered robotic boats to clean up lakes, rivers, and seas. Nowadays, most of the industries around the world are full of innovations such as AI-based industrial robots, machines, and tools.</p>
