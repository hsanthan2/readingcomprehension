            <p>In the city of Florence, there once lived a nobleman called Signor Carrado. He was famous for his banquets and his love of hunting. One day, he caught a fine crane.</p> 

            <p>While Chico, the cook, was roasting the bird for a banquet, a pretty maid passed through the kitchen. The roast smelled so delicious that she persuaded Chico to give her a leg for her supper. When the platter was set in front of Signor Corrado, he immediately summoned Chico to demand what had happened to the leg.</p>
	    <p>“Sir, didn’t you know cranes have only one leg?” said Chico.</p>
	    <p>“Nonsense!” said the nobleman.</p> 
	    <p>Next morning, he took Chico with his other attendants to the river. As they rode along, Chico saw a flock of cranes asleep, all standing on one leg.</p>
	    <p>“There, sir, I was right! Cranes have only one leg!” cried Chico.</p>
	    <p>“Is that so?” replied Signor Corrado, determined not to be defeated by his cook. He clapped his hands, and the startled cranes rose up in the air. As everyone could see, the birds had two legs.</p>
	    <p>“But, sir,” said quick-witted Chico, “if you had clapped your hands at the table yesterday, the roast bird would have uncurled its other leg!”</p>
	    <p>Everyone laughed so heartily at this that Signor Corrado could not help being amused.</p>
	    <p>“Well said, Chico! There’s nothing like a clever cook.” The nobleman winked. “But from now on, just be sure that every bird you cook has two legs!”</p>
