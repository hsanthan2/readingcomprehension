            <p>On 26 December 2004, an earthquake rocked Sumatra, and <b>triggered</b> off a series of massive tsunamis that destroyed cities and seaside communities, killing great numbers of people. These effects are so <b>devastating</b> that rebuilding of the affected areas is still ongoing today. To date, the number of recorded deaths is more than a quarter million, and properties amounting to billions of dollars have been destroyed.</p>

            <p>What is a tsunami? Well, it is actually a series of huge waves which are caused by an undersea earthquake or volcano. These gigantic waves can move at speeds of 720 kilometers per hour. As they <b>approach</b> the shore, they can reach heights of 30 meters, and <b>crash</b> onto land. Their speeds allow them to cause great destruction on the shore. After this disaster, efforts have been made to develop tsunami-warning systems, and <b>programmes</b> have been established to understand tsunamis better. These programmes are being used to educate people on what they can do if they should ever be hit by a tsunami.</p>
            <p>Earthquakes often come together with volcanic eruptions. In late 1984, strong earthquakes began shaking the Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Columbia every day. On November 14, 1985, it erupted. A nearby river became a sea of mud that buried four towns. This disaster killed more than 2100 people.</p>
	    <p>People who live in earthquake zones should expect earthquakes. They should be <b>prepared</b> to protect their lives and properties. They must build safer buildings and roads. <b>Seismologists</b> are trying to find ways to use knowledge about earthquakes to save lives.</p>
