            <p>Most people go to sleep at night. So do many animals. But a few animals sleep most of the day. Then they stay up all night. These animals can use their senses to get around in the dark. Owls, skunks, and moths all stay up at night. The owl has very large eyes that can see in the dark. Skunk is a small black and white North American animal that can produce a strong, unpleasant smell to defend itself when it is attacked. Moths fly mainly at night and are attracted to bright light. Both the skunk and the moth have very strong sense of smell. They can smell other animals from very far away.</p>

            <p>Why do some animals stay up all night? Sometimes it is because nighttime is the best time to hunt. In hot places, animals can stay cooler at night. And they can avoid predators who are dangerous for their lives. There are many more reasons animals come out at night.</p>
