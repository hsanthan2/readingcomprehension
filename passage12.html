            <p>Forests and trees are not just pretty to look at. They do an important job, making the earth’s environment for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if it continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write a paper for school. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of 
		an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and neighborhoods have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the tree Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle, you can help save the world’s forests.</p>
