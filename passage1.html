            <h4>Read the passage with correct pronunciation, pause or stop while scanning. Then, read it more carefully to have good comprehension. The meaning of new words should be thought of by contextual clues.</h4>

            <p>In many parts of the world, there are mountains with holes at their tops, and quite often, smoke, fire, and streams of very hot liquid rock, lava, come out of those holes. Such mountains are called volcanoes, and the holes at their tops are called craters. The word "Vulcan" comes from the god of fire of the ancient Romans.</p>

            <p>When a volcano is pouring out smoke, fire, and lava, we say that it is erupting. Before a volcano erupts, there is usually a rumble, a deep, heavy, continuous sound. Gradually, the rumble gets louder and louder. Smoke and fire soon begin to come out of the crater. Then, with a very loud noise, the mountain top explodes, or bursts open, and lava flows down its sides. At the same time, bits of hot rocks are thrown high into the sky.</p>

            <p>Volcanoes that keep erupting almost all the time are called active volcanoes, and there are about five hundred of them in the world. Those that have ceased to erupt are called extinct volcanoes, and Mount Popa is one of them.</p>
