            <p>Acid rain is one of the biggest <b>environmental</b> problems today. It has many long-term effects, like damage to trees and buildings. It can lead to skin and breathing problems. It can also cause animals to become extinct. Acid rain is caused by air <b>pollution</b> from cars and factories. These machines burn fuel for energy. When fuel burns, it produces smoke and invisible gases that mix with clouds. These dark clouds rain harmful <b>chemicals</b> onto the earth. Although the rain is not acidic enough to burn skin, it coats tree leaves, buildings, and the ground with <b>toxic</b> water.</p>

            <p>Acid rain has actually been around since the mid-1800s. It was discovered by Robert Angus Smith. Smith found a <b>relationship</b> between acid rain and air pollution. However, scientists did not start studying acid rain seriously until the 1950s. Acid rain can be prevented by burning less dangerous fuels. Factories have also <b>experimented</b> with special filters that remove harmful chemicals from the smoke. These are good <b>solutions</b>, but governments have to act fast. If they wait, the damage may be unstoppable.</p>
