            <p>It is argued that schools should only teach appropriate subjects that are beneficial to students’ future jobs, and for subjects like music and sports, this shouldn’t be taught to them. From my <b>perspective</b>, I do not agree with this statement saying sports and music are not as important as school subjects as these lessons can also provide <b>passion</b> and successful dream jobs to them.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, some people regard sports and music as unimportant curricula for students, but in my opinion, teaching subjects like these can be very beneficial to students who have no leisure time and only have to study 24 hours a week. Firstly, by learning about music theory, their school <b>burdens</b> can be reduced, and then knowing these notes can improve option choice for their future careers; for example, world-famous singers like Justin Biber can’t be famous if he never gets in touch with music in the early age. He knows from the beginning that music is the one that he is passionate about and only music <b>career</b> can give him satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Sports, on the other hand, is also a crucial subject for youngsters. Learning sports at school has so many advantages not only for their mental health but also for student’s physical health. Doing activities like football, basketball, and tennis can reduce their stress and also <b>enhance</b> their ability of brain function. Last but not least, we will never know that in real life these sports can make them a professional athlete in one day who earns more salary than other companies’ employees.</p>
	    <p>Overall, I believe that learning about sports and music should <b>keep up</b> the good work in the future so that we can have some early dreamers who will achieve their future goals.</p>
